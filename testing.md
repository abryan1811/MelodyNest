## Bugs

### 

- New users cannot access profiles 

- MongoDB filling up with unused data

- When a user updates a new piece, it changes all the other details on genre and instrument to say the same for every piece.(in profile view only).

    - This bug was due to a syntax error, and was a simple and obvious fix. At the bottom of the user profile, it needed to go below all the information in the for loop.
